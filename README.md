# Module 5 Challenge

## Problem
In the challenge we were provided with two csv files for Pymaceuticals. One CSV has mouse data that has information on mouse and drug regimen the mouse is under. The other CSV captures data for study done on individual mouses related to tumor size. In this challenge, we used these data to draw inferences and draw different types of charts using matplotlib, pyplot and scipy.

## Location of source

* **Code** : Pymaceuticals/pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb
* **Data** : Pymaceuticals/Mouse_metadata.csv and Pymaceuticals/Study_results.csv

## Learnings
* We learned using libraries pyplot in matplotlib, stats in scipy.
* We also used pandas library to manipulate dataframes and series.
* We learned creating bar charts, pie charts, boxcharts, line, scatter plots.
* We learned finding quartiles and outliers, correlation and regression.
